            <aside>
                All of this shit is under "The Motherfucking Licence".<br>
                And, it's fucking perfect.

        <h2>
            Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This shit is public as fuck. Any motherfucker in the universe can use it.
            It's part of the public domain, you sick fuck. And, it's for you own fucking good.</p>
        <h3>
            That's right, motherfucker:
        </h3>
        <p>
            You can use this shit in any way, shape or form. Download. Copy. Fork. Use.
            Modify. Publish. Distribute. Go ahead. I give you permission to do whatever
            the fuck you want with it. That is, if you have the brains to do anything with
            this shitty divine masterpiece. You can even stick it in your motherfucking ass,
            I don't give a fuck. Throw it into the interwebs. Share it on your shitty
            social medias. If you are an indecent son-of-a-bitch, you don't even have to
            mention that I made this. Go on. Claim it as yours, motherfucker. I don't
            fucking care.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bet this is the only license that gets the fucking point across. And yet,
            you still think I'm gonna sue you. Get your shitty shit together. You really
            think I'm gonna waste my fucking time and money running after you? Wrong,
            motherfucker. If you do shitty things with this, I will personally come to
            your house and beat your stinky ass. I'll turn you upside down, you
            motherfucker. So if you dare use this, use it for the good of this fucked up
            world, you smurf.
        </p>
